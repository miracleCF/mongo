********************************************************************************
Dear database developper and users in Spatial domain, welcome to use
MongoDB MapViewer.
  
* MongoDB MapViewer is an application with GUI to demonstrate the capabilities 
  of R-tree powered MongoDB. With this application, users could import, 
  view and query projected spatial data. 
 
================================================================================
* MongoDB MapViewer was develolped within Qt creater 5 (Community version), 
  and in addition, the following three libraries are needed:
  
  1. MongoDB legacy CXX driver, used to access MongoDB database.
     download at: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/tree/legacy. 
    
  2. Boost libs 1.58.0 or higher, which is depent by MongoDB driver.
     Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/

  3. GDAL, used to read shape files.
     Download at: http://www.gdal.org/

  Then, the project file, i.e. "./Source Code/mongoView.pro", should be 
  configured to set libs and heads to include the above three libraries.
  
  Note: MongoDB master CXX driver (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/tree/master)
  also works for MongoDB MapViewer

=================================================================================
* Compile history: 
  
  OS           Version     Status   
  Window 10    64 Bit      Pass
  Ubuntu 16.04 64 Bit      Pass
  
  Since Qt is a cross-platform UI framework,Other OS may work but not tested.
  If you are interested, please try it and tell us the results.
  
==================================================================================
* Use binary directly

  Too complicated? directly try pre-compiled binary, which is available here, 
  for both Window and Ubuntu. Check it out in "./precompiled binaries/[you OS]"
  You can run the windows version directly, but the Ubuntu version requires 
  additional libs (*.so) installed in your system
